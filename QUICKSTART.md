## Two Scanning Modes

### üîç Shop Scanner Mode (NEW!)

**What it does:** Quickly checks which shops exist

**Output:** Text file with working shop names
```
working_shops.txt:
  techstore
  fashionhub
  electronics
```

**Use when:**
- You want to build a list of active shops
- You need to validate shop names
- You want to filter out non-existent shops before full scraping

**Speed:** Very fast (only HTTP request, no parsing)

---

### üì¶ Full Scraper Mode

**What it does:** Gets complete product data from shops

**Output:** CSV file with all products
```csv
shop_name,product_name,price,stock
techstore,Laptop Pro,999.99,15
techstore,USB Cable,9.99,250
```

**Use when:**
- You need product catalogs
- Price monitoring
- Inventory tracking

**Speed:** Slower (parses JSON, extracts all products)

---

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Efficient Two-Pass Scraping

**Goal:** Scrape products only from shops that exist

```
Step 1: Shop Scanner
  Input:  all_shops.txt (500,000 shops)
  Output: working_shops.txt (12,000 shops)
  Time:   ~45 minutes

Step 2: Full Scraper
  Input:  working_shops.txt (12,000 shops)
  Output: products.csv (450,000 products)
  Time:   ~15 minutes
  
Total Time: 60 minutes
Single-Pass Time: 4+ hours ‚ùå
```

**Savings: 75% faster!** ‚ö°

---

### Workflow 2: Weekly Shop Validation

**Goal:** Keep your shop list up-to-date

```
Monday: Shop Scanner ‚Üí current_shops.txt
Compare: current_shops.txt vs last_week_shops.txt
New shops: 145 found
Dead shops: 78 removed
```

---

### Workflow 3: API Testing

**Goal:** Test API availability

```
Shop Scanner Mode
Conservative preset (no rate limiting issues)
Small test wordlist (100 shops)
‚Üí Validate API is working
```

---

## Performance Presets

### üêå Conservative
- **Speed:** ~25 shops/second
- **Risk:** Very low
- **Use for:** Rate-limited APIs, testing

### ‚ö° Balanced (Recommended)
- **Speed:** ~50-100 shops/second
- **Risk:** Low
- **Use for:** Most scenarios

### üöÄ Aggressive
- **Speed:** ~100-200 shops/second
- **Risk:** Medium (possible rate limiting)
- **Use for:** Unlimited APIs, maximum speed

---

## Examples

### Example 1: First Time Use (GUI)

```bash
python advanced-finder-gui.py
```

1. Select "üîç Shop Scanner"
2. Keep defaults (words.txt ‚Üí working_shops.txt)
3. Choose "‚ö° Balanced" preset
4. Start!

**Result:** `working_shops.txt` with all active shops

---

### Example 2: Full Scrape (CLI)

```bash
python advanced-finder.py \
  --wordlist working_shops.txt \
  --output products.csv \
  --max-concurrent 100
```

**Result:** `products.csv` with all products

---

### Example 3: Custom API (GUI)

```bash
python advanced-finder-gui.py
```

1. Select mode
2. Set URL: `https://api.mysite.com/store/{shop}/items`
3. Aggressive preset
4. Start!

---

## Troubleshooting

### No shops found
- ‚úÖ Check URL template has `{shop}` placeholder
- ‚úÖ Verify wordlist format (one name per line)
- ‚úÖ Test with 2-3 known shop names first

### Too slow
- ‚úÖ Use Shop Scanner mode (10x faster than Full Scraper)
- ‚úÖ Increase concurrency: `--max-concurrent 100`
- ‚úÖ Decrease delay: `--rate-limit 0.05`

### Getting rate limited
- ‚úÖ Use Conservative preset
- ‚úÖ Increase `--rate-limit` to 0.5 or 1.0
- ‚úÖ Decrease `--max-concurrent` to 20 or 10

### GUI not working
```bash
pip install rich questionary --upgrade
```
